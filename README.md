# Introduction

## About API Key
### API Key Notice
* Access to OpenAPI-related interfaces requires an API Key. Please visit this page to set up your API Key.
* When configuring the API Key, for security purposes, ensure that your IP address is added to the access whitelist, which supports up to 30 IPs.
* Do not share your API key with anyone. In case of accidental exposure, promptly delete the key and generate a new one.

###  API Key permission setting instructions
*   - The newly generated API Key can be assigned a permission type. Currently, there are three roles available: Administrator, Trader, and Observer. Each role has access to different interfaces. For detailed information, [please refer Here.](https://github.com/dfxlabs/dfxlabs.github.io/blob/main/docs/OpenApi.md)
