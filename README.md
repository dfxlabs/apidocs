## About API Key
### API Key note
* openApi related interfaces require API Key to access. Please refer to this page to set API Key.
* When setting the API Key, for security reasons, your IP must be set as an access whitelist, which supports up to 30 IPs.
* Do not tell anyone your API key. If the API key is accidentally leaked, please delete the key immediately and generate a new key.

### API Key permission setting instructions
* The newly created API Key can select the permission type. Currently, there are three roles: Administrator, Trader, and Observer. The interfaces that each role can access are different. For details, [please refer Here.](https://github.com/dfxlabs/dfxlabs.github.io/blob/main/docs/OpenApi.md)
